## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder) # dataset
library(finalfit)
library(broom)
library(gtsummary)#install.packages("gtsummary")
#library(sjmic)#install.packages("sjmic")
library(sjlabelled)#install.packages("sjlabelled")
library(lubridate)#install.packages("lubridate")
library(sjlabelled)
library(psych)
library(Hmisc)
library(expss)#install.packages("expss")
```

## 1.2 data set ready

```{r}
# Import the data I worked on for weeks
USHSv2 <- read_csv("USHSv2.csv")
#Some of the variables I plan to use was not selected into my data set. 
#I'll get the raw data and merge them.
USHS <- read.csv("daF3224e.csv", sep = ";") 
USHSv2 <- left_join(USHS, USHSv2) # USHSv2 is still the name.
#select the variables I'm going to use.

```

## 1.3 Generating new variables for modelling 

### 1.3.1 Generating variable about 1-year medical help seeking practice
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# questions under k37 collected information about whether and how much medical
#help seeking behaviors (MHSB) the respondents had for the past one year for 
#various  type of medical providers. Here I simplified them into whether they  
#have MHSB for any type of service. 
#select columns k37s

col_k37s <- USHSv2  %>% select (starts_with("k37"))

#How many types of medical provider he/she saw 1~5 times last year.
col_k37s <- col_k37s  %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(med_seek_face_few =sum(
    across (starts_with("k37")&contains("_2_")) == 1, na.rm = T))%>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  apply_labels(., med_seek_face_few = "Medical visits a few times")

#How many types of medical provider he/she saw >5 times last year.
#a new variable
col_k37s <- col_k37s  %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(med_seek_face_many =sum(
    across (starts_with("k37")&contains("_2_")) == 2, na.rm = T))%>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  apply_labels(., med_seek_face_many = "Medical vistis many times")

#How many types of medical service he/she saw via phone last year.
#a new variable
col_k37s <- col_k37s  %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(med_seek_phone =sum(
    across (starts_with("k37")&contains("_3_")) == 3, na.rm = T))%>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  apply_labels(., med_seek_phone = "Medical phone call")

#How many types of medical service he/she saw via internet last year.
#a new variable
col_k37s <- col_k37s  %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(med_seek_online =sum(
    across (starts_with("k37")&contains("_4_")) == 4, na.rm = T))%>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  apply_labels(., med_seek_online = "Medical help seeking on-line")


#If he/she sought any medical help during last year (yes/no)
#This is a combination of the four new variables above, if any of them has
#a value of 1, this new variable also gets a value of 1, or else it gets 0.

### 1.3.2 Generating variable about length of sedentary hours

```{r}

#answers blended hours and minutes. Here I unified their unit into hours.

columns <- USHSv2 %>% select(starts_with("k42")) %>% names()

#check their variable type, finding they are characters.
sapply(USHSv2[,columns], class)

#transform into time(period) variable and check if done
USHSv2[,columns] <- lapply(USHSv2[,columns], function(x)hms(x, quiet = T))
sapply(USHSv2[,columns], class)

USHSv2[,columns]
#transform minutes into hours and added up hour with transformed hours
#hereby 6 variables were generated, each being the length of sitting for
#a type of behavior, see variable labels
